	 "<p>My Eagle project was the culmination of the planning, communication, and leadership  skills developed during my 10 years in the Scouting program.</p>" +
		 "<p>For my project, I designed and built a picnic area and trailhead for a local township wonder: the Hoffheimer Grotto. During this project, I worked closely with township officials, troop leadership, teachers, local historians and friends  for guidance. The project totaled over 500 people hours including more than 100 hours of planning.</p>" +
		 "<p>Each constructed piece of the project was thoroughly drawn and dimensioned in AutoDesk inventor. I also worked with Adobe Photoshop to design and create a historical poster detailing the history of the Hoffheimer Grotto.</p>",
